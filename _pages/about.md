I am currently a Young Professor at [Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIMIT, CAS)](http://www.sim.ac.cn/). Previously I was an Associate Professor at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I obtained my Ph.D. from School of Mechanical Engineering at the same university in December, 2018. My doctoral thesis was awarded “Outstanding PhD Thesis of SJTU” (15 out of 1200 PhD graduates) in 2018. I have published over 50 peer-reviewed papers in journals like International Journal of Heat & Mass Transfer, Physical Review B, Physical Review A, Nano Letters, Science Advances, Advanced Optical Materials, etc. I was awarded several important awards including Asian Union of Thermal Science and Engineering (AUTSE) Young Scientist Award (2020), Shanghai Natural Science Award (First Class, 2020), Best Paper Award of the 6th ASME Micro/Nanoscale Heat & Mass Transfer (MNHMT) International Conference (2019). I serve as the Scientific Council Member of the International Centre of Heat and Mass Transfer (ICHMT), Member of Youth Working Committee of the Heat Transfer Society of China. I also serve as associate editors for several international journals like Journal of Thermal Science and Carbon Neutrality, as well as reviewers for Optica, Advanced Materials series and Physical Review series.


**Research interest:** I am now leading the SIMIT Thermal Radiation Group at [2020 X-Lab](http://www.sim.cas.cn/kybm2016/xlab/), Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am also co-supervising the SJTU Thermal Radiation Group with [Prof. Changying Zhao](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhaochangyin.html). I am interested in the theory of light (thermal radiation)-matter interactions in nanostructures and cold atoms, especially the rich physics regarding non-Hermitian, topological, disorder and quantum effects. On this basis, we conduct far- and near-field experiments on nanoscale light-matter interactions. By tailoring these nanoscale interactions, we work towards applications, aiming at efficient energy transport/conversion, high resolution imaging and information processing.
